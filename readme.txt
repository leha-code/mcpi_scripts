This folder contains scripts that I like, wether made by me or not.
(Unless they are too big and needed a seperate directory)

These scripts are made for Minecraft: Pi Edition,
Scripts may not be written in the best / most efficient way.

All scripts work on the Raspberry Pi Model B.
Scripts that use pollBlockHits do not work in SUvival Mode (patch).

Scripts that use mc.camera or pollBlockHits do not work on the Raspberry Jam Mod.
Some scripts will not work or will need to be changed to fit the PC version such as:
-shield.py the water in the center slows you down.
-infiniteTNT.py you cannot break TNTs as fast as on the RPi.
-all_entities_here.py crashes the game (but it still works)
